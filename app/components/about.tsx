                In 2011, I was deep into the world of Minecraft. But I wasn&apos;t just playingâ€”I&apos;m crafting. Crafting mods, to be exact. And just like that, without even realizing it, I had stumbled into the universe of coding.
                Fast-forward to the present day, and I&apos;ve been fortunate enough to bring my visions to life in VR. I&apos;ve worked on immersive VR applications that, quite honestly, feel like I&apos;m living out my Minecraft modding dreams on a grand scale.

                I&apos;ve also been delving into the realms of AI and have found it to be as fascinating as it is challenging. And when I&apos;m not bringing to life robots or virtual worlds, I enjoy the creativity of web development. From freelance projects to building just for the sheer joy of it.

                When the screen&apos;s glow gets a bit too much, you&apos;ll find me in the kitchen, experimenting with recipes and flavors. If I&apos;m not burning pasta, I&apos;m either out on the soccer field, feeling the adrenaline rush at the go-kart tracks, or on my couch, catching the latest F1 race.

                So, welcome to my world. It&apos;s a mix of VR, AI, and pasta sauce, and I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way.
