                In 2011, I was deep into the world of Minecraft. But I wasn't just playingâ€”I'm crafting. Crafting mods, to be exact. And just like that, without even realizing it, I had stumbled into the universe of coding.
                Fast-forward to the present day, and I've been fortunate enough to bring my visions to life in VR. I've worked on immersive VR applications that, quite honestly, feel like I'm living out my Minecraft modding dreams on a grand scale.

                I've also been delving into the realms of AI and have found it to be as fascinating as it is challenging. And when I'm not bringing to life robots or virtual worlds, I enjoy the creativity of web development. From freelance projects to building just for the sheer joy of it.

                When the screen's glow gets a bit too much, you'll find me in the kitchen, experimenting with recipes and flavors. If I'm not burning pasta, I'm either out on the soccer field, feeling the adrenaline rush at the go-kart tracks, or on my couch, catching the latest F1 race.

            <p className="text-md text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                So, welcome to my world. It's a mix of VR, AI, and pasta sauce, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
