                In 2014, I was utterly obsessed with <span className={`text-violet-500 font-bold ${styles['highlight-minecraft']}`}>Minecraft</span>. But I wasn't just playingâ€”I was crafting. Crafting <span className={`text-violet-500 font-bold ${styles['highlight-mods']}`}>mods</span>, to be exact. Without even realizing it, I had stumbled into the amazing world of <span className={`text-violet-500 font-bold ${styles['highlight-coding']}`}>coding</span>.

            <p className="text-md text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Fast-forward to the present day, and I've been fortunate enough to bring my dreams to life in <span className={`text-violet-500 font-bold ${styles['highlight-vr']}`}>VR</span>. I've worked on immersive VR applications that, quite honestly, feel like I'm living out my Minecraft modding dreams on a grand scale.

                I've also been exploring the complexities of <span className={`text-violet-500 font-bold ${styles['highlight-ai']}`}>AI</span> and have found it to be as fascinating as it is challenging. I'm equally drawn to <span className={`text-violet-500 font-bold ${styles['highlight-webdev']}`}>web development</span>'s creativity, creating everything from freelance projects to random web games.

                When the screen's glow gets a bit too bright, you'll find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and flavors. If I'm not burning pasta, I'm either out on the soccer field or on my couch, catching the latest <span className={`text-violet-500 font-bold ${styles['highlight-f1']}`}>F1 race</span>.

                So, welcome to my world. It's a mix of VR, AI, and pasta sauce. I wouldn't have it any other way.
